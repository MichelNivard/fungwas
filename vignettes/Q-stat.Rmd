# Overview

In this vignette we show how to use the **Q statistic** in `fungwas` to compare
parametric mappings of quantile GWAS slopes to competing distributional models.

The Q statistic is defined as

[
Q = (b - W \hat\theta)^\top \hat\Sigma^{-1} (b - W \hat\theta),
]

where:

* (b) are the observed quantile slopes,
* (W \hat\theta) are the slopes implied by the fitted parametric model,
* (\hat\Sigma) is the estimated covariance of the slopes.

A small Q indicates that the model is consistent with the observed slopes.
A larger Q indicates misfit.

**Important caveat:**
Because the covariance estimates (\hat\Sigma) used here are approximate (especially under diagonal or plugin modes), the **Q statistic should be interpreted heuristically**. It is not a formal likelihood-ratio test. In practice, the main diagnostic is whether a model’s *average Q* is much smaller than that of an alternative model. Absolute calibration against chi-square reference distributions is unreliable.



# Example: vQTL vs Log-normal Model

We simulate phenotypes from a **mean + variance QTL model**, and then compare fit against a **log-normal model** where the SNP only influences the mean (with variance tied through the log-normal link).

```{r simulate}
# -------------------------
# 1. Simulate genotypes
# -------------------------
N <- 15000
P <- 500
maf <- runif(P, 0.05, 0.5)
G <- matrix(rbinom(N * P, 2, rep(maf, each = N)), nrow = N, ncol = P)
colnames(G) <- paste0("SNP", seq_len(P))

# -------------------------
# 2. Define true effects
# -------------------------
beta_mu_true     <- rnorm(P) / 40
beta_sigma2_true <- rnorm(P) / 40

# -------------------------
# 3. Simulate phenotype
# -------------------------
mu0 <- 4.0
sd0 <- 0.6

mu <- mu0 + G %*% beta_mu_true
sigma2 <- sd0^2 + G %*% beta_sigma2_true
sigma2[sigma2 <= 0] <- 1e-4  # guard against negative variances

Y <- rnorm(N, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(sigma2))
```


# Stage 1: Quantile GWAS

We first compute quantile slopes using RIF regression.

```{r stage1}
taus <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
stage1 <- quantile_gwas(
  Y, G,
  taus = taus,
  benchmark = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```



# Stage 2: Correct Model (Mean + Variance QTL)

We map slopes to mean and variance parameters using `make_weights_vqtl`.

```{r correct-model}
W_var <- make_weights_vqtl(taus, stage1$q_tau, mu = mean(Y), sd = sd(Y))

fit_correct <- param_gwas(
  stage1,
  transform = "custom_W",
  transform_args = list(W = W_var),
  se_mode = "dwls"
)
```


# Stage 2: Wrong Model (Log-normal)

We now compare against a log-normal distribution. Here, effects on the meanlog implicitly alter both the mean and variance, but without an independent variance parameter.

```{r wrong-model}
logY <- log(Y)
fitlog <- list(
  estimate = c(meanlog = mean(logY), sdlog = sd(logY))
)
q_tau <- as.numeric(quantile(Y, taus, type = 8))

dist_cdf <- function(y, params) plnorm(y, meanlog = params$meanlog, sdlog = params$sdlog)
dist_pdf <- function(y, params) dlnorm(y, meanlog = params$meanlog, sdlog = params$sdlog)

grad_fd_meanlog <- make_fd_grad("meanlog", dist_cdf)
grad_fd_sdlog   <- make_fd_grad("sdlog", dist_cdf)

W_fd <- make_weights_generic(
  taus, q_tau, dist_cdf, dist_pdf,
  params = list(meanlog = fitlog$estimate[1], sdlog = fitlog$estimate[2]),
  grad_funcs = list(beta_meanlog = grad_fd_meanlog,
                    beta_sdlog   = grad_fd_sdlog)
)

fit_wrong <- param_gwas(
  stage1,
  transform = "custom_W",
  transform_args = list(W = W_fd),
  se_mode = "dwls"
)
```



# Compare Q Statistics

```{r compare-Q}
cat("\n--- Model Comparison ---\n")
cat("Correct model Q (per SNP):\n")
print(summary(fit_correct$Q))

cat("\nWrong model Q (per SNP):\n")
print(summary(fit_wrong$Q))

cat("\nAverage Q difference (wrong - correct):\n")
mean(fit_wrong$Q - fit_correct$Q)

plot(fit_correct$Q - fit_wrong$Q,
     main = "Q(correct) - Q(wrong) per SNP",
     ylab = "ΔQ", xlab = "SNP index")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
```

In this example, the **true vQTL model yields systematically lower Q values** than the misspecified log-normal model, confirming that the variance effects are necessary to explain the quantile slopes.


# Key Takeaways

* The **Q statistic in `fungwas` is a heuristic measure of model adequacy**, not a calibrated chi-square test.
* When comparing competing models, a **large difference in average Q** provides evidence for which model better captures the distributional shape of the phenotype.
* However, because SEs are approximate, absolute reference to chi-square distributions is discouraged.
* In practice, Q is best used to ask: *Does my chosen parametric system capture the quantile slopes better than a simpler alternative?*


# Conclusion

The Q statistic provides a useful way to compare alternative parametric models in `fungwas`.
It should be seen as a **diagnostic tool**, helping identify whether variance effects, mixtures, or other parameters are needed to describe the phenotype distribution, rather than as a formal hypothesis test.
